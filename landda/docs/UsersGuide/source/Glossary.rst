   container
      `Docker <https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container>`__ describes a container as "a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another."

   data assimilation
      One of the major sources of error in weather and climate forecasts is uncertainty related to the initial conditions that are used to generate future predictions. Even the most precise instruments have a small range of unavoidable measurement error, which means that tiny measurement errors (e.g., related to atmospheric conditions and instrument location) can compound over time. These small differences result in very similar forecasts in the short term (i.e., minutes, hours), but they cause widely divergent forecasts in the long term. Data assimilation systems seek to mitigate this problem by combining the most timely observational data with other sources of data, such as historical data, to provide an analysis of possible atmospheric states and the probabilities of each. Errors in weather and climate forecasts can also arise because models are imperfect representations of reality. Data assimilation systems can use techniques including stochastic physics, which applies randomized perturbations to the physical tendencies or the physical parameters of a model, to compensate for model uncertainty. 
   
   HPC
      High-Performance Computing.

   MPI
      MPI stands for Message Passing Interface. An MPI is a standardized communication system used in parallel programming. It establishes portable and efficient syntax for the exchange of messages and data between multiple processors that are used by a single computer program. An MPI is required for high-performance computing (HPC) systems.

   UFS
      The Unified Forecast System (UFS) is a community-based, coupled, comprehensive Earth modeling system consisting of several applications (apps). These apps span regional to global domains and sub-hourly to seasonal time scales. The UFS is designed to support the :term:`Weather Enterprise` and to be the source system for NOAA's operational numerical weather prediction applications.

   Weather Enterprise
      Individuals and organizations from public, private, and academic sectors that contribute to the research, development, and production of weather forecast products; primary consumers of these weather forecast products.
